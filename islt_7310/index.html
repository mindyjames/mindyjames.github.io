            <h3 id="welcome">Welcome</h3>
                <p id="welcome_paragraph">In my youth, I would always try to snag the biggest serving of treats before my sister could beat me to it. With age, I have realized that it is not about getting the biggest piece, but it is about sharing the best part with others. In this site, I have compiled the best slice of my learning technology and design work to share with you.</p>
            <br/>
            
            <h3 id="vision">Vision</h3>
                <p>My early career experience was in customer service; I often received perfect survey scores for my customer service skills which really comes down to listening to others. This translates well to leadership roles, human resources, training and development, and K-12 education, all areas in which I have had success. I believe these same skills contribute to making me a good learning designer; I never forget to listen to people in the process. I currently apply learning technology and design in my position as a middle school teacher, but I have a vision to combine my corporate and K-12 education experience into job skills training and support for atypical learners and under-resourced populations.</p>
